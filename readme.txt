A WordPress plugin to help campsite owners integrate the Camping Key Europe purchase functionality by SCR.

== Description ==
This plugin gives you a shortcode that can be used anywhere, on pages and in sidebar widgets, to display either a text link or banner to the purchasing iframe.

The shortcode be configured with a few parameters, which will control how it show. The langauge parameter is optional, while the text or banner parameter is mandatory.
